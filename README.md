<li><strong>Automation & Manual Testing</strong> – Because no bug should go unnoticed!</li>
<li><strong>API Testing & Data Validation</strong> – Making sure everything behind the scenes works as expected.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD & GitHub Actions</strong> – Automating test execution like a pro.</li>
<li><strong>Cypress, JavaScript, Postman, SQL</strong> – My go-to tech stack for keeping quality in check.</li>
