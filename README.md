## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Katie51/Katie51** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a Software Quality Engineer with a passion for building smooth, bug-free experiences. With 5+ years in manual and automation testing, Iâ€™ve worked across web and mobile platforms, making sure everything runs like a well-oiled machine.

ğŸ”¹ What I do best:

Automation & Manual Testing â€“ Because no bug should go unnoticed!
API Testing & Data Validation â€“ Making sure everything behind the scenes works as expected.
CI/CD & GitHub Actions â€“ Automating test execution like a pro.
Cypress, JavaScript, Postman, SQL â€“ My go-to tech stack for keeping quality in check.
ğŸ’¡ I love solving problems, improving testing processes, and collaborating with developers to ship high-quality products faster. If you're into QA, tech, or just want to chat about testing strategies, letâ€™s connect! ğŸš€
